       " 'it usually takes 2 light cycles to get across wide streets. One driver in a black Jeep Cherokee pulled up and said \"Uber\". I was dispatched a completly different make & color which showed up across the street. I informed the Jeep Cherokee he was not my driver and he sped off.  Check vehicle license plates for your safety always. Tonite I was in front of Tulane University matched on the app specifcally at the address.  2 Uber vehicles were dispatched and both supposedly were within 100\\' and just disappeared off the app. The third vehicle said \"arrived\". I noticed a vehicle across Elk Place and streetcar tracks and the neutral zone which is local speak for a medium. I texted the driver numerous times asking if he had his flashers on? No response. I hurried across the wide street and verified by license plate he was my driver, pointed in the opposite direction of my hotel. Driver was completely unresponsive to me asking if he recieved my messages or knew my destination.  My phone is a S24, 6 weeks old with Verizon.On the Uber app there is no space to email or write out issues. Just numerous possible issues pick and choose but no dialog. I wonder is Lyft is any better. Uber adjusted the fare a couple of bucks. I would rather pay more for better service and not have to walk any further.',\n",
       " 'parking, Hubby used the Uber rides this year. When he was ready to leave about 10:30 is when things went down hill. He had a difficult time getting a ride. Multiple drivers declined him because they \"can\\'t go down the street\" the bar is on. When he finally got a driver, he had to walk 2 blocks away from where he was to meet the driver. This is horrible service and super dangerous! The same thing happened to 2 other employees there That left after my husband did. You have highly intoxicated people try to get home safely. Then you require them to walk 2 blocks drunk, in the dark, and unfamiliar with the area. To top it off, the drivers drove right by the bar while taking them home.Now granted I don\\'t know why the drivers \"can\\'t go down that street\" to pick up rides. Perhaps there has been previous issues with riders. However, that has to be a better compromise for customers being responsible and not driving. Safety should be the top priority in my opinion.',\n",
       " 'quoted estimated wait time was an hour from the order being placed. The delivery driver picked up the food 30 minutes after the order was placed. I spoke with them and asked if they had any other deliveries to drop off before delivering mine, and he said yes, he had a \"few\".My food arrived 45 minutes later, and it was cold. Anyone who uses Ubereats knows that the quoted delivery window shown on the order status screen will update itself by extending the \"latest delivery by\" number as the order progresses and the first quoted \"latest delivery by\" time passes by.I attempted to seek recompense through the dystopian chat bot labyrinth, but each agent had the same script, the same copied and pasted chunks of text about how hard Uber is striving to address my concerns and how genuinely invested they personally are in my satisfaction. It will turn out that this is not factually correct! Shocking, I know!The agent told me that since my order arrived on time (within their quoted timeframe, which kept lengthening as to become meaningless), they can\\'t refund anything. That doesn\\'t make sense, since they kept changing the timeframe they were using to justify their refusal!What\\'s worse, they even said this multiple times: \"we don\\'t offer compensation for orders being the wrong temperature.\" In other words, they do not care if the food is hot or cold when it gets to me. Wow. They even word it in a way that makes it seem like I am wrong to expect hot (or at least warm!) food. That actually took this cynical soul by surprise. To paraphrase Ruben Rabasa, \"Oh my god [they] admit it.\"This is evil and they are a soulless company whose customer service department is a facade. What can be done other than a warning to avoid them at all costs? This is really dystopian and depressing.',\n",

I finally found an employee to help me I informed Franklin of that, and I told him it would be a couple of minutes because it was far from me. When I finally got to where I think he was, I got a message saying that he cancelled the trip. Your app offers no way to provide this feedback. I cannot give him a rating as the trip was cancelled.
